# Tkinter Machine Learning Image Classifier

GUI based machine learning classifier created using Tkinter and Tensorflow VGG16 pre-trained classifier. This Python program, has then been converted into an executable using Pyinstaller and NSIS (in order to download just the needed dependencies to create the EXE file, a virtual environment has been used). 

```python
pyinstaller main.spec
```
