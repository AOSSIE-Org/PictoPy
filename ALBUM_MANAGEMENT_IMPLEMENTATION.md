### 3. Album Page Integration
**File:** `frontend/src/pages/Album/Album.tsx`

**Updates:**
- Integrated `EditAlbumDialog` and `DeleteAlbumDialog`
- State management for dialog visibility
- Handler functions for create, edit, and delete operations
- Proper callback functions for post-operation actions

### 4. AlbumList Component Updates
**File:** `frontend/src/components/Album/AlbumList.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Updated `onDeleteAlbum` callback signature to include album name
- Passes album name to delete handler for confirmation dialog

### 5. AlbumDetail Component Integration
**File:** `frontend/src/components/Album/AlbumDetail.tsx`

**Features:**

## API Functions

All required API functions were already properly implemented in `frontend/src/api/api-functions/albums.ts`:

- ✅ `updateAlbum(albumId, albumData)` - Update album details
- ✅ `deleteAlbum(albumId)` - Delete album
- ✅ `fetchAlbum(albumId)` - Get album details
- ✅ `createAlbum(albumData)` - Create new album

## Redux Integration

**Album Slice** (`frontend/src/features/albumSlice.ts`):
- ✅ `updateAlbum` action - Updates album in store
- ✅ `removeAlbum` action - Removes album from store
- ✅ `addAlbum` action - Adds new album to store

## TypeScript Type Safety

All components have proper TypeScript typing:

1. **Interface Definitions:**
   - Component props interfaces
   - API request/response types
   - Redux action payloads

2. **Type Safety:**
   - Form event handlers properly typed
   - State variables with explicit types
   - API function parameters and return types
   - Redux actions with typed payloads

3. **No Type Errors:**
   - All files compile without TypeScript errors
   - Proper use of React types for events
   - Correct Redux typing patterns

## Features Completed

✅ **Delete Album** - Newly implemented with confirmation
✅ **View Album Details** - Already implemented in `AlbumDetail.tsx`
✅ **Add Images to Album** - Already implemented in `AddToAlbumDialog.tsx`
✅ **Remove Images from Album** - Already implemented in `AlbumDetail.tsx`
✅ **Hidden Album Support** - Password protection for edit/delete
✅ **Redux State Management** - Full integration with store
✅ **TypeScript Types** - Complete type coverage
✅ **Form Validation** - Input validation with error messages
✅ **Loading States** - User feedback during operations
✅ **Error Handling** - Proper error messages and notifications
✅ **Responsive Design** - Mobile-friendly dialogs

## User Flows

### Edit Album Flow
1. User clicks "Edit" button in AlbumList or AlbumDetail
2. EditAlbumDialog opens and fetches current album data
3. Form pre-fills with existing album information
4. User modifies name, description, or visibility settings
5. If album was hidden, current password is required
6. If making album hidden or changing password, new password can be set
7. Form validation ensures all required fields are filled
8. On submit, API updates album and Redux store is updated
9. Success notification shown and dialog closes

### Delete Album Flow
1. User clicks "Delete" button in AlbumList or AlbumDetail
2. DeleteAlbumDialog opens with album details
3. User must type exact album name to confirm
4. Warning shown if album is hidden
5. Enter key or Delete button triggers deletion
6. API deletes album and Redux store is updated
7. Success notification shown
8. User is navigated back to albums list (from detail view) or list refreshes

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Edit Album:**
   - Test editing public albums
   - Test editing hidden albums with password
   - Test changing album from public to hidden
   - Test changing album from hidden to public
   - Test password changes for hidden albums
   - Test form validation errors

2. **Delete Album:**
   - Test deleting public albums
   - Test deleting hidden albums
   - Test confirmation validation (must type exact name)
   - Test cancellation
   - Test keyboard interaction (Enter key)

3. **Integration:**
   - Test Redux store updates after operations
   - Test navigation after deletion
   - Test error handling for network failures
   - Test loading states

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/src/components/Album/EditAlbumDialog.tsx` (NEW)
2. `frontend/src/components/Album/DeleteAlbumDialog.tsx` (NEW)
3. `frontend/src/pages/Album/Album.tsx` (UPDATED)
4. `frontend/src/components/Album/AlbumList.tsx` (UPDATED)
5. `frontend/src/components/Album/AlbumDetail.tsx` (UPDATED)
6. `frontend/src/types/react.d.ts` (FIXED - removed duplicate type declarations)
7. `frontend/src/types/global.d.ts` (FIXED - removed conflicting React type declarations)

## Dependencies

All required dependencies were already present in the project:
- React Query (via `usePictoQuery` and `usePictoMutation`)
- Redux Toolkit (for state management)
- React Router (for navigation)
- Shadcn/ui components (Dialog, Button, Input, etc.)
- Lucide React (for icons)

## Conclusion

The comprehensive album management system has been fully implemented with:
- Complete CRUD operations for albums
- TypeScript type safety throughout
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Redux integration for state management
- Mobile-responsive design
- Accessibility considerations

All TypeScript errors have been resolved, and the implementation follows best practices for React, TypeScript, and Redux development.
