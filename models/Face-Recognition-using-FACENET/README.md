# Face-Recognition-using-FACENET
Artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world is known as computer vision. Computer vision tries to replicate the functions of the human visual system to identify and process different objects in images or videos.  It is one of the most powerful techniques used extensively to detect and label objects in images or videos. The recent inventions in artificial intelligence have outshined humans in detecting and labeling objects.

# FACENET Model
The FaceNet model is a facial recognition model released by a team of Google researchers in 2015 and is based upon two previously-launched models for image classification, ZF-Net and Inception. 

# Haar Cascade Classifiers
It is a classification algorithm used by computer vision engineers to perform object detection and is based on the principle of edge detection using haar-like features. 

# AIM
ML projects aiming to extract faces from images and identify/classify a person's face in images and videos.

# Methodology for Performing Face Detection 
- The images of each character are obtained from the Youtube video and stored in a separate folder.

- Each face from the respective folder is read and resized using the required format for the model requirements.

- Then pixels extracted are required to go specific pre-processing to extract meaningful information from weights or a model.

- Depending on the requirement, the extracted embeddings or weights are sent as input to an ML/DL model.

- Faces from a frame or a video are to be extracted using Haar Cascade Object Detection for face extraction.

- Model training for identifying faces extracted from Haar Cascade and labeling if it meets certain thresholds and others.

- Label a personâ€™s name in frames or a video.

## Future Commits
- Flask Deployment
- Ability to let user select image from local system and use it for predictions
