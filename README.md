# Architecture

### Frontend

- **Tauri**: Enables building the desktop application
- **React**: Used for creating the user interface
- **Rust**: Powers the backend, which the frontend communicates with through Tauri's API

### Backend (Python)

- **FastAPI**: Serves as the API framework
- **SQLite**: Database for storing metadata and embeddings
- **YOLO**: Used for object detection
- **FaceNet**: Generates face embeddings
- **ONNX Runtime**: Runs the models efficiently
- **DBSCAN**: Performs clustering for face embeddings

### Backend (Rust via Tauri)

Handles file system operations and provides a secure bridge between the frontend and local system.

## Features

- Smart tagging of photos based on detected objects, faces, and their recognition
- Traditional gallery features of album management
- Advanced image analysis with object detection and facial recognition
- Privacy-focused design with offline functionality
- Efficient data handling and parallel processing
- Smart search and retrieval
- Cross-platform compatibility
