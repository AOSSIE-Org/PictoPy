        - Verify correct and explicit visibility modifiers for all state variables and functions.
        - Flag variables that are declared but used only once or are unnecessary.
        - Identify potential gas optimization opportunities without compromising readability or security.
        - Verify that any modification to contract logic includes corresponding updates to automated tests.
        - Ensure failure paths and revert scenarios are explicitly handled and validated.
        - Validate proper access control enforcement (e.g., Ownable, RBAC, role checks).
        - Ensure consistent and correct event emission for all state-changing operations.
        - Confirm architectural consistency with existing contracts (no unintended storage layout changes unless clearly documented).
