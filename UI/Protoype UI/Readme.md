To run this prototype UI, run the main.py file in the directory!

Basic idea of a UI for the application, will work more on it if this proposal is selected for GSoC! The main screen is the suggestions page, while the other screens are all functionally different things like View all images, People Sorted by face, Sorted Gallery feature where images are sorted by people, scenery, or objects in them, and a User Page for displaying vital user information. My thinking was that the UI needs to be finalized before moving onto the backend logic.

Make sure you have PyQt5, PyQt5-tools and PyQt6, PyQt6-tools libraries installed.
