## Tech Stack

The PictoPy application is built using a combination of modern web and software technologies. Here's a detailed breakdown of the tech stack:

### **Backend:**

- **Flask (Python)**
  - **Purpose:** Flask is a lightweight Python web framework used to handle HTTP requests, manage routing, and serve the application.
  - **Details:** Flask provides the core web server functionality and is responsible for handling requests, processing data, and interacting with the database.

- **SQLite**
  - **Purpose:** SQLite is a lightweight, file-based relational database used to store media metadata, classifications, and user data.
  - **Details:** SQLite is chosen for its simplicity and ease of use in lightweight applications. It supports SQL queries and transactions, making it suitable for this project.

### **Frontend:**

- **HTML5**
  - **Purpose:** HTML is used for structuring the web application's content.
  - **Details:** HTML5 provides the structure for web pages, including elements for displaying media, navigation menus, and interactive forms.

- **CSS3**
  - **Purpose:** CSS is used for styling the web application's appearance.
  - **Details:** CSS3 is utilized for layout design, responsive styling, and visual enhancements such as rounded corners and card layouts.

- **JavaScript**
  - **Purpose:** JavaScript is used for client-side scripting, making the web application interactive and dynamic.
  - **Details:** JavaScript handles user interactions, AJAX requests, and dynamic content updates. It is responsible for enhancing the user experience by providing responsive and interactive features.

### **Media Processing:**

- **OpenCV**
  - **Purpose:** OpenCV is used for image processing and computer vision tasks.
  - **Details:** OpenCV helps with tasks such as image resizing, filtering, and manipulation, which are crucial for media handling and display.

- **YOLOv8**
  - **Purpose:** YOLOv8 is used for object detection and classification.
  - **Details:** YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm that classifies and detects objects in images, providing metadata for media files.

### **Containerization:**

- **Docker**
  - **Purpose:** Docker is used to create and manage containers for the application.
  - **Details:** Docker allows for consistent and isolated execution of the application, ensuring that it runs the same way in different environments.

- **Docker Compose**
  - **Purpose:** Docker Compose is used to define and run multi-container Docker applications.
  - **Details:** Docker Compose helps in orchestrating multiple containers, such as the web server, database, and other dependencies, making it easier to manage complex setups.

### **Packaging:**

- **PyInstaller**
  - **Purpose:** PyInstaller is used to convert Python scripts into standalone executables.
  - **Details:** PyInstaller packages the application into a single executable file, making it easier to distribute and run on systems without requiring a Python interpreter.
