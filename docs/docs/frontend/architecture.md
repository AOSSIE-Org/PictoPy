## State Management with Redux

Our application uses Redux for state management. Here are the main slices:

### Auth Slice
Handles user authentication state including login, logout, and session management.

### Image Processing Slice
Manages state related to image upload, processing, and results.

### Settings Slice
Controls application settings and preferences.
