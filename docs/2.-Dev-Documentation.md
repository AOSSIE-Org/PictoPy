## Development Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions for setting up the PictoPy development environment, running the application, and understanding its architecture. Follow these steps to contribute to the project or customize it for your needs.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

### Running the Application

PictoPy can be run in two main interfaces: Browser Interface and Native Interface.

#### Browser Interface

The Browser Interface allows you to run PictoPy as a web application accessible via a browser.

**Option 1: Using Docker Compose**

**Requirements:**
- Docker
- Docker Compose

**Steps:**

1. **Build and start the containers:**
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```
   This command will build the Docker image and start the container as specified in `compose.yaml`.

2. **Access the application:**
   Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000.

**Option 2: Using Python Virtual Environment**

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Pip (Python package installer)

**Steps:**

1. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. **Access the application:**
   Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000.

#### Native Interface

The Native Interface allows you to run PictoPy as a standalone application. 
> **Note:** this is not suitable for non-native environments like Replit, GitHub Codespaces, or IDx.

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Pip (Python package installer)

**Steps:**

1. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Build the native application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
